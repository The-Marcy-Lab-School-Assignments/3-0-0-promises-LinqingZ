# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` is printed first, followed by `Inside promise`. The console.log is Synchronous Execution that it will be call before the asynchronous call promise to resolve the inside promise, then it will setup a callback to be executed once the promise is resolved.
